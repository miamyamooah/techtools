                    <h3>Resource 8: The Magic Behind ChatGPT </h3>
                    <p> This article delves into the underlying mechanics of ChatGPT's development, specifically focusing on the process of reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). It explains how this approach enhances the model's ability to generate coherent, contextually accurate responses by incorporating human feedback into the training process. The article breaks down the stages of RLHF, including data collection, model training, and iterative improvements, and highlights the role of human reviewers in guiding the AI's learning. Through this methodology, ChatGPT becomes more aligned with human expectations, making it a powerful tool for various applications, including conversational agents, content creation, and more. </p>

                    <h3>Resource 9: AI Can Be Objective/Unbiased </h3>
                    <p> This article addresses the common misconception that artificial intelligence (AI) systems are inherently objective and free from bias. It explores the reality that AI systems, including machine learning algorithms, can still reflect and perpetuate biases present in the data used to train them. The piece emphasizes that human biases, whether intentional or not, can be embedded in datasets, leading AI systems to make decisions that may inadvertently favor certain groups over others. The article stresses the importance of recognizing and addressing these biases to ensure that AI technology is developed and used ethically, promoting fairness and accountability in its applications. </p>

                    <p> In this article, Maha Bali explores various perspectives on the use of artificial intelligence in educational contexts. The article highlights the potential risks and ethical concerns associated with AI, including its capacity to reinforce inequalities, reduce human interaction in learning, and create a reliance on technology that may undermine critical thinking. Bali discusses the importance of balancing innovation with caution, advocating for a thoughtful, inclusive approach to integrating AI into education that prioritizes equity, privacy, and the preservation of meaningful human engagement. The piece also encourages educators and policymakers to critically assess AI's role in shaping educational practices and its impact on students' learning experiences. </p>
