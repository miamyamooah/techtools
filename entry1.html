                <h2>M1 : The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Education </h2>
                <img src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/grid-AI.jpg" alt="Post 1">
                <p>Welcome to my first blog post! Today, we are going to be discussing Artificial Intelligence and how it has rapidly evolved into a daily tool that is used across various industries but most importantly, within the education system. </p>
               <h3> What is AI?</h3>
                <p>According to the University of Illinois Chicago, AI is a piece of machine learning technology which is capable of replacing human intellect. This includes problem solving, creating content, fraud detection, make decisions, and much more. The earliest records of AI use date back to the 1950s', but did not hold a prominent role in educational technology until the 1990s'. Originally, we referred to AI as Synthetic Intelligence and first saw it being used at a summer research project in 1956 at Dartmouth College. The goal was to discuss machine learning and share ideas on development for creating these intelligent machines. Over time, AI progressed and in the 1990s' we saw a surge in research, resulting in the use of <a href="https://kili-technology.com/data-labeling/computer-vision/natural-language-processing-and-computer-vision" style="color: #3D7A93; font-weight: bold;">NLP</a>, or Natural Language Processing, which helps machines understand human language. In modern society, AI has taken the world by storm and has entered mainstream education, providing teachers with data-driven insights; as well as automating administrative tasks such as grading. This allows educators to spend less time on paperwork and more time on teaching, which benefits students as well.</p>
                <h3> How Do We Use AI? </h3>
                <p>Today, AI is used in a variety of ways, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Personalized Learning: Adjust the difficulty level of specific tasks based on students' individual progress, ensuring no child falls behind while also challenging advanced learners. Applications include DreamBox and Smart Sparrow.</li>
                        <li>Intelligent Tutoring Systems: Provide real-time feedback and guidance. Applications include Squirrel AI. </li>
                        <li>Automated Grading and Administrative Tasks: Help educators automate grading, which in turn frees up time to ensure more impactful time with students. Applications include Gradescope. </li>
                        <li>AI for Teacher Support: AI-driven insights and lesson planning to better understand specific student needs as well as create customized learning plans. Applications include ChatGPT and Google Classroom AI. </li>
                    </ul>
                <h3> The Future of AI in Education </h3>
                <p> Looking into the future, AI has a prominent role in classrooms and is only expected to grow. Within the next five years, I assume that AI will become even more adept at analyzing data, recommending content, and providing tailored support. Perhaps the use of Artificial Intelligence can serve as a virtual learning assistant that can work with kids to complete homework, manage classrooms, answer questions, and provide feedback. Additionally, AI could be used by schools to aid in the lifelong learning process by recommending courses and resources that align with personal and career goals. Finally, AI could assist in equity and accessability by ensuring students from different backgrounds, including those with disabilities, can receive the support they need to thrive. This would include transcribing content, offering text-to-speech capabilities, or even providing real-time translations. 
                <h3>Real-World Example</h3>
                <p> One example of AI's impact is Georgia Tech’s AI Teaching Assistant (Jill Watson). Jill Watson, an AI developed by Georgia Tech, was used to answer student questions in an online course. The AI was so effective that students never realized they were interacting with a machine instead of a human assistant. This innovation showcases the potential for AI to assist in both educational support and administrative functions, allowing teachers to focus on higher-level teaching. </p>
                <h3>Looking Forward</h3>
                <p> Artificial Intelligence is everywhere, impacting the future of education and its role is only going to grow. From personalized learning to automated grading, AI is changing the way we learn and it is time we changed with it. Over the next five years, we can all expect AI to revolutionize the way we teach, learn, and manage our classrooms by aiding educators in making their classrooms more accessible and equitable. Personally, I cannot wait to see how technology will change and all of the improvements it will bring. </p>
